		<h2>So you want to start a community bioloab.</h2>
		<p>Sure, you can buy a couple of pieces of used equipment on eBay and have a lab in your basement. There's actually nothing illegal about that, at least on the federal level in the United States, as long as your intentions are harmless. But the magic of community labs is that they become places where people from diverse backgrounds come together to do really cool stuff. It's always more fun to do stuff together.</p>
		<p>But there's another reason you need other people. The old proverb, "It takes a village to raise a child", really is applicable to launching a community biolab. Even if the biolab is your "child", it truly requires the support of a community to get it off the ground. The biolab requires so much time and diverse skillsets, that it needs to be a group effort to be successful. Communities take time to develop - you need to begin fostering a community even before you consider the technical aspects of the lab (space, equipment, operations, etc).</p>
		<p>The following three sections will guide you through the key considerations when beginning to develop the community. Please take time to consider these section very carefully - a strong community is the most critical driver of long-term success of a community biolab.</p>

			<h3>Make sure your community is ready for a lab. Before you start planning, get a temperature check of the broader community. This check will enable you to answer a critical question:</h3>
			<h4 class="question">Can my community support a biolab? </h4>
			<p>A dedicated biolab requires amount of support from a community. Make sure there is sufficient commitment from a large enough community to enable the successful operation and utilization of a biolab. If you can't get the meaningful commitment of at least 10 people, strongly consider starting smaller at first. A biology club is a better way to start things off, until you cultivate a community large enough to support a biolab.</p>
			<h4 class="question">What are some good ways to get a temperature check of the community?</h4>
			<p><strong>Meetups.</strong> Meetup.com is a great tool and resource for tapping your community. Attend any science or biology-focused meetups in your town and gauge their level of interest in a community biolab. Start a meetup group to begin cultivating your town's biology community and build support for a biolab.</p>
			<p><strong>Attend events.</strong> Science fairs and lectures are great aggregators of the broader community. Attend or even set up a booth to start building interest in a community biolab.</p>
			<p><strong>Run small events.</strong> Host biology events that do not require a biolab. Activities like strawberry DNA extraction are a great way to give people a lightweight, hands-on experience. People who enjoy the activity may want to take their explorations further.</p>
