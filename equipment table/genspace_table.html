<tr>
<td>PCR Machine/Thermal Cycler</td>
<td>Using controlled temperature cycling, causes PCR reactions to occur.</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pipettors</td>
<td>Measures very tiny amounts of liquids precisely</td>
<td>Multiple sizes will be needed. We sugest your lab acquires P2, P20, P200, & P1000 models. The number signifies the maximum amount of liquid the pipettor will draw in µliters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Centrifuge</td>
<td>Spins tubes very fast to separate materials of different densities</td>
<td>Start with at least a microfuge (spins 1.5mL tubes) and get your hands on a larger refrigerated 'fuge if you can later to spin 15mL and 50mL tubes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gel Electrophoresis Box</td>
<td>Device that uses electric current to separate DNA fragments based on size.</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gel Electrophoresis Power Supply</td>
<td>Used to power an electrophoresis box</td>
<td>Should supply a voltage up to 200 volts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3" class="rowheader">Cold storage devices</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Refrigerator</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>A small 4.4 cf ft refrigerator will suffice</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Constant Temperature Freezer (-20°C), manual defrost model</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Most modern freezers have a freeze/thaw cycle that keeps frost from building up. For the lab, the freezer must not have such a cycle and must maintain a constant termperature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Liquid Nitrogen or -80C freezer</td>
<td>For long-term sample storage and cells such as competent E. coli</td>
<td>Usually on the wish list but too expensive to buy immediately</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Incubator (37°C)</td>
<td>Maintains a constant temperature to grow cultures</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vortex Mixer</td>
<td>Used to quickly mix liquids in a tube by vibrating rapidly</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Balances</td>
<td>Analytical balance (mg weights) and top-loader (grams)</td>
<td>You will eventaully need this. Try to get the top-loaded immediately and then hunt for the analytical.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UV or Blue Light Box</td>
<td>Used to visualize stained DNA in electrophoresis gels</td>
<td>If you use Ethidium Bromide, you need a UV box -include a plexi shield so as not to damage your retinas! Most DIYbio groups have switched to SybrGreen, a non-hazardous stain that can be visualized in blue light or UV light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Microwave Oven</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Small size required. Should be large enough to hold a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask. For research use ONLY. If you want to make popcorn or heat up lunch get an additional oven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Glassware</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Erlenmeyer Flasks</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>250 ml size</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Graduated Cylinders</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>100 ml and 1000 ml size</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beakers</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>200 ml</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Autoclave or pressure cooker</td>
<td>steam sterilizer, used to make sterile media, sterilize objects</td>
<td>very expensive- the pressure cooker is the poor man's alternative but a real autoclave is better. If you can find one on eBay and can afford it, get one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>water bath or heat block</td>
<td>Maintains a constant temperature, can be used to heat tubes in experiments or thaw things</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>shaker or rotator</td>
<td>needed for bacterial culture</td>
<td>a combination incubator-shaker is best, but pricey. You can put a small tube rotator in the 37C incubator to achieve the same effect. Your cultures will just grow a little slower.</td>

<tr>
<td>tube racks for water baths, boiling</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>some clever designs float, or lock the caps down</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>scissors, tweezers</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td>butane torch for flaming</td>
<td>useful if you are going to do bacterial culture or yeast work</td>
<td>like they use to make Crème Brulee</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>freezer boxes</td>
<td>to store samples</td>
<td>expensive but worth it. Could they be 3D-printed?</td>
